Google Analytics extension for MediaWiki
========================================

This extension adds the Google Analytics tracking snippet to every page.

**Please note**: this is a fork of [Extension:GoogleAnalytics](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Google_Analytics_Integration).
There are the following differences:

* We still use the older ```ga.js``` instead of Universal Analytics
* We have a few more options (see #Configuration)
* Upstream has some test coverage while we don't
* There's a slightly different code structure.


## Configuration ##

* Users with the "noanalytics" right are exempt from tracking;
  by default this is applied only to bots
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsAccount```: your analytics account number (e.g. "UA-12345678-1")
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsDomainName```:  see [setDomainName].
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsCookiePath```: See [setCookiePath].
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsEnahncedLinkAttribution```: Enables [EnhancedLinkAttribution]. Off by default.
     You must also enable "Use enhanced link attribution" in GA settings.
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsSegmentByGroup```: Push the user's groups into a custom var, allowing later
     segmentation in the GA dashboard. Off by default.
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsTrackExtLinks```: track clicks on external links (including interwiki and
     interlanguage) using events. On by default.
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsDemographics```: Use DoubleClick's dc.js instead of ga.js, in order to track
     demographics. Seems to be blocked more by users. See [dc.js]
* ```$wgGoogleAnalyticsPageGrouping```: Kol-Zchut specific! off by default. Classify pages into
     Content Groups, based on the first 2 visible categories.
